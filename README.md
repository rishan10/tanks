Tanks Project Proposal

The story we are telling is tanks firing at a building. We are going to animate a group of tanks firing at a building. In the end, the building will be reduced to rubble. To achieve this, we need to use an amalgam of topics covered in the graphics course. The first topic we use is the ability to build models in the models space. To build the tank, we might need to define new shapes not in tiny graphics so that will mean using indexed structures to define the polyhedron. Next, we use all the transformations we learned in class to bring these shapes into the world space. This will take rotations, translations, and scaling. Next we need concepts like lighting, shading to correctly animate the bullets firing, and the building crumbling. We will allow users to control the position of the tanks with the wasd characters on the laptop to control where it fires. We are going to need to use a lot of physics to simulate the building crumbling by the bullets. We also will have a mode where we can change the perspective to a first person view of the tank. In order to do this, we need to apply the eye space transformations that we learned in class to position the eye/perspective on the canons of the tanks so that it appears as if we are in a first person view. This will involve concepts such as change of basis and rotation transformations. Overall this should be a fun and interesting project to work on that will encompass the graphics concepts weâ€™ve learned in class. We plan to add the advanced feature of physics-based destruction and collisions - as the tanks shoot at parts of the building in the animation, the pieces of the building accurately react to the impacts and fall down realistically. Some other advanced features we could add are particle effects for the bullets as well as for the destruction for the building and more detailed tanks and building.
